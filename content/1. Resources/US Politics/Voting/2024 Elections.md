## [[County commissioner#What is a County commissioner|County Commissioner]]
- [Interview of the candidates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbM3SlAH3GU)

### Randy Agnew
Randy has a ton of experience in government. He was a programmer and has a great record as county council member for rock island. He wants to increase development for new housing which i think is very needed. we have a supply issue in douglas county

### Paula Lamanna
Seems like a nice gal. She has much less experience. She seemed to not have very solid ideas on what she needs to do as commissioner. I liked her answer a bit more on a needle programm for the area. 

### County Commissioner Summary
I think that I am leaning towards Agnew. This is subject to change if i find any news of him supporting trump policies.

## [[Public Utility District Commisioner]]

### Ron Skagen 
Skagen is the sitting president for PUD. His big recent policy was reserving the power output from the local damn to be used only for small buisness and residential buildings. Stopping heavy industrial users of power like crypto and microsoft from pulling from that pool and instead needing to purchase their own power. 

##D Mathew Hepner
Has no overtly stated goals aside from transparency. I don't know his veiws on green energy

### PUD Summary
I like Skagen better. He has a proven track record and a commitment to clean energy.
