# Negative claims and counters


## Claim 1: Harris "put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana."

### Response: 
Marajuana was illegal in California until 2016. The same year that Harris
became a senator. It’s important to note that Harris did not prosecute the marajuana
charges herself but it was lower level courts that did that. Harris currently
supports the legalization of marajuana.

 1,883 admissions to state prison on marijuana offenses during the years Harris was
 attorney general. There were another 92 admissions for crimes related to hashish, a
 drug made from cannabis resin. Notably, the figures dropped dramatically during
 Harris’ tenure, from 817 marijuana-related admissions in her first year in office to
 137 in her last.

## Claim 2: Harris "blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so."

Response: This is referring to case of Kevin Cooper, a black man on death row for
commuting a quadruple homicide.. The evidence in question was new advanced dna
testing. Harris was not directly involved in the decision to deny the testing though
her office was.  once she learned about it in a New York Times article she called on
the state to allow the testing. 

Claim 3: Harris "kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap
labor for the state of California."
    Response:  This claim comes from a February [Daily Beast
    article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-ag-office-tried-to-keep-inmates-locked-up-for-cheap-labor).
        lawyers in then AG Harris’ office argued in 2014 that, despite court orders to reduce
        state prison crowding, some non-violent offenders needed to stay in the prison system
        to help combat wildfires. A spokesperson for Harris was quoted in the article saying,
        "Senator Harris was shocked and troubled by the use of this argument. She looked into
        it and directed the department’s attorneys not to make that argument again."
