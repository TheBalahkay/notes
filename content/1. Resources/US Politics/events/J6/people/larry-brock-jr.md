6. Parading, Demonstrating, or Picketing in a Capitol Building in violation of

#### Appeal: 
Because the law and the record in this case foreclose Brock’s legal and
sufficiency challenges, we affirm Brock’s Section 1512(c)(2) conviction. As for
Brock’s sentence, we hold that the “administration of justice” enhancement does
not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral
votes. For that reason, we vacate Brock’s sentence for his Section 1512(c)(2)
conviction and remand to the district court for **resentencing**.

#### Conviction: 
convicted on all charges after a 3 day bench trial.

#### Sentencing Guidelines: 
faces up to 20 years of imprisonment, a term of supervised release of not more
than three years, a fine up to $250,000, and a mandatory special assessment of
$100 for Count One; up to one year of imprisonment, a term of supervised
release of not more than one year, a fine up to $100,000, and a mandatory
special assessment of $25 for each of Counts Two and Three; and up to six
months of imprisonment, a fine up to $5,000, and a mandatory special assessment
of $10 for each ofCounts Four through Six.
    
- Brock’s Guidelines imprisonment range is 57 to 71
months’ imprisonment.

As shown in Section II(B) of this memorandum, Larry Brock’s felonious conduct
on January 6, 2021 was part of a massive riot that almost succeeded in
preventing the certification vote from being carried out, frustrating the
peaceful transition of Presidential power, and throwing the United States into
a Constitutional crisis. The nature and circumstances of Larry Brock’s offenses
were of the utmost seriousness, and fully support the government’s recommended
sentence of 60 months’ incarceration, 36 months’ supervised release, and $2,000
restitution,.

sentenced to two years in prison, 100 hours of community service, and two years
of supervised release after his prison sentence

Prosecutors had recommended a sentence of five years in prison followed by
three years of supervised release.

Brock waived his right to a jury trial-- look into why. is there a standard for
this?

Bates (judge): That’s chilling stuff, and it does reflect a purpose to stop the
certification of the election

stormed the United States Capitol building on January 6, dressed in tactical
gear, and on a mission



Brock Quotes from social media:

- Nov. 9. 2020: When we get to the bottom of this conspiracy we need to execute
  the traitors that are trying to steal the election, and that includes the
  leaders of the media and social media aiding and abetting the coup plotters,
- Brock bragged to his friends about the tactical gear he was buying in
  anticipation of January 6, even saying he “preferred outright insurrection at
  this point.” 
- On November 7, 2020: A revolution every now and then is a good thing
- November 8, 2020: “Biden outperformed Obama? Right! I have said it before and
  I will say it again. If the President calls, will answer. #OathKeeper.
- November 9, 2020: When we get to the bottom of this conspiracy we need to
  execute the traitors that are trying to steal the election, and that includes
  the leaders of the media and social media aiding and abetting the coup
  plotters.
- November 13, 2020: I believe the courts will act, but if they don’t, are we
  willing to see the will of the American people be thwarted? What exactly
  constitutes supporting and defending the Constitution … against all enemies,
  foreign and domestic. Does stealing an election through fraud make one
  a domestic enemy? If so, what are we prepared to do?
- December 5, 2020: “If SCOTUS3 doesn’t act we have two choices. We can either
  live in a Communist Country or we can rebel, keep the rightful President in
  power and demand free and fair elections. #civilwar2021
- December 6, 2020: Going to get a lot scarier if SCOTUS doesn’t act. No way in
  hell we should accept this rigged election. We need to restore the
  Constitution and the best and shortest way is to go offensive on the
  Communists that stole it, aka the Democratic Party
- December 11, 2020: It appears as if SCOTUS is going to duck. If so then it
  will be game on soon. We need ROE, a clear chain of Command ending with
  President Trump and a master target list
- December 18, 2020: Brock engaged in a conversation with Beaf Supreame about
  the 2020 election, referencing the upcoming Inauguration on January 20, 2021,
  with Brock saying that he was “ready to go at it”. Beaf Supreame brought up
  the possibility of an “IO6 loss if a cop got hurt.”
    - IO: Information Operations, and that Information Operations is a broad
      concept that is used in the military to denote using information to shape
      what the enemy does
- December 24, 2020: I bought myself body armor and a helmet for the civil war
  that is coming



Private Message to Beaf Supreame: 


```markdown
Assumption: US Military isn’t involved Objection: Restore the rule of law in
the rebellious states, hold a free and fair election in 1 year

Plan of Action if Congress fails to act on 6 January Main Tasks:

1. Seize all democratic politicians and Biden key staff and select Republicans
   (Thune and McConnell). Begin interrogations using measures we used on Al
   Queda to gain evidence on the coup

2. Have General Flynn get in touch with President Trump and have him declare
   a State of Insurrection exists to provide color of law to our actions

3. Seize national media assets and key personnel. Zuck, Jack, CNN lead and
   talking heads, seize WAPO and NYT editors. Eliminate them. Media silence
   except for White House communications

4. Present slate for clean elections to existing congress and make sure they
   sign.

5. Let the Democratic cities burn. Cut off power and food to all who oppose us.

6. Establish provisional government in rebellious states and representatives we
   can count on.

7. Cease all foreign aid except for key allies as determined by Trump

8. General pardon for all crimes up to and including murder of those restoring
   the Constitution and putting down the Democratic Insurrection. ROE:
    1. Do not kill LEO12 unless necessary. Gas would assist in this if we can
       get it.
    2. Attempt to capture Democrats with knowledge of coup
    3. Shoot and destroy enemy communication nodes and key personnel
    4. So many sub tasks I can’t even imagine them
