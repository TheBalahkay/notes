4 Pillars for DT Debates 
1. Donald Trump lead a coup against the United States.
 
2. You must acknowledge that Fox News knowingly told you the exact same lies
   that Donald Trump tried to tell state election boards, his officers in
   government, and his voter base/supporters? Every single person at Fox News
   knew very early on that every single Sydney Powel and Rudy Giuliani claim
   was utterly bullshit, so much so that they were pre-emptively removing them
   from shows and confronting them on their lack of evidence.
   
3. The Supreme Court granted Trump immunity to escape criminal charges, they
   tossed part of the 14th amendment, the Republicans in the Supreme Court
   didn't convict because he was out of office, and he pardons all of his
   friends. There is no accountability. Why didn't he pardon those on J6?
