TRUMP 2024

That moment when someone says, "I can't believe you would vote for Trump," I simply reply:

1. "I'm not voting for Trump, I'm voting for the First Amendment and freedom of speech.
	- trump wants to put people in prison who burn the flag. Regardless of your opinion on the act, the action should and is protected by the first amendment. It is a huge part of what makes this country great. we can criticize it and not be jailed. Putting someone in jail for burning the flag is akin to people in north Korea being jailed for not having a picture of the supreme leader in their house. its un-American.
	- Trump has gone after media companies directly. calling the press the enemy of the people. last I checked freedom of press is a key 1st amendment freedom. We already have legal recourse by way of defamation. If you cant prove it in court then you have no right to restrict what the other person or company is saying. period. The executive branch of our government should not be attacking anyone over speech. if trump hates what is said so much then sue for defamation as a citizen. not the president.
2. I'm voting for the Second Amendment and my right to defend my life and my family.
	- bump stock ban
	- against 3D printed and "ghost guns"
	- Feb, 28, 2018: In a meeting with lawmakers, Trump said, “I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida. He had a lot of firearms. They saw everything. To go to court would have taken a long time. So you could do exactly what you’re saying, but take the guns first, go through due process second.”
3. I'm voting for the next Supreme Court Justice(s) to protect the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
	- Trump is on record saying he would like to suspend the constitution to go after voter fraud. 
		- "What I said was that when there is 'MASSIVE & WIDESPREAD FRAUD & DECEPTION,' as has been irrefutably proven in the 2020 Presidential Election, steps must be immediately taken to RIGHT THE WRONG," Trump added. "Only FOOLS would disagree with that and accept STOLEN ELECTIONS. MAGA!"

4. I’m voting for the continued growth of my retirement 401K and the stock market.
	- Trumps Economic policy for the upcoming term is aweful. He wants to cut interest rates. but that will cause inflation. I hate it but we need interest to stay up until inflation is down and stable
	- Trump had the largest deficit spending of any president ever.
5. I’m voting for a return of our troops from foreign countries and the end to America’s involvement in foreign conflicts.
	-  Trumps foreign policy was laughable. He is the first president to ever salute another countries flag
	- took pictures with kim jung un and legitimized him on the world stage
	- created a plan to leave afganistan that included deals with the taliban that he did not inform afgan allies of. this is a huge reason why the pullout ended so bad
	- Led the peace accords with the middle east and isreal but did not include palestine. The countries that were involved were already well on the way to peace anyways.
	- moved the capital to jeruselam which probably helped lead to the oct 7th attack
	- Threatened to leave NATO. This is nuts. NATO is the only thing keeping russia at bay. NATO is hugely important to world stability.
6. I'm voting for the Electoral College and for the Republic in which we live.
	- Trump literally tried to overturn the vote of seven states by getting rid of their electoral votes
7. I'm voting for the Police to be respected once again and to ensure Law & Order.
	- I think they should be respected too but do you really want them to have full federal immunity? really? thats a huge expansion of governmental power. It opens up the door to unbelievable abuse
8. I’m voting for the continued appointment of Federal Judges who respect the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
	- Like giving the president CRIMINAL IMMUNITY? This is literally the largest expansion in governmental and executive power in our lifetime.

I’m voting for our jobs to remain in America and not be outsourced all over again to China, Mexico and other foreign countries.

10. I’m voting for secure borders and legal immigration.
	-  Trump literally blocked a bi partisan border reform bill written by a republican because he wanted it to be a campaign issue against Biden

11. I'm voting for the Military & the Veterans who fought for this Country to give the American people their freedoms.
	- Trump wants to cut veteran benefits

I'm voting for the unborn babies that have a right to live.

I’m voting for the continued peace progress in the Middle East.
- jeruselam 
- peace accords
- abandoning allies

I’m voting to fight against human/child trafficking.
- border reform blocked.
- epsteins island and flight logs

	- https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21165424-epstein-flight-logs-released-in-usa-vs-maxwell

I’m voting for Freedom of Religion.

I'm voting for the right to speak my opinion and not be censored.
- trump openly calls to censor those he diragrees with
- burning the american flag = prison

I'm voting for my children and my grandchildren to ensure their freedoms and their future.
- your children think that you are destroying democracy by supporting a dictatorial man

I'm not just voting for one person, I'm voting for the future of my Country.”

Are you?
