### For mom:
Start at why I think Kamala is a better pick
Explain why I think the totality of events on j6 constitute a coup attempt even if trump thinks that he was doing so was justified.
- If mom says: of course he did, the was voter fraud. Look at x case or y case
	- If she says this bite and ask her that if what trump did did under the legal definition is a coup, then what trump did would be considered a justified coup. 
		- Go onto voter fraud arts: 
			- Why did his own judges go against him
			- how could so many case over so many states by so many judges rule against him.
				- Standing is important
				- Some did go through, and found nothing
				- The ones that did, were in such small. Umbers that it couldnâ€™t overturn a single county 
				- How could a gov that you have seen from the local lrocess is so disorganized that it can simultaneously be incompetent and able to organize plots across such a grand scale and have them go their way. And have no evidence of something like this in any of the court cases.
