“Unlike some states, Washington does not require transgender student athletes to undergo hormone replacement therapy or suppression of the hormones naturally produced by their bodies. Transgender athletes in Washington also are not required to disclose their medical information to play high school sports.” 

“The 16-year-old Garcia pulled away from her opponents with a time of 55.75 seconds in the final – a full second ahead of the second-place finisher at the state meet at Mount Tahoma High School last weekend.

Her win helped the East Valley Knights win the 2A title. Garcia did not set a state meet record in the 400. That is held by Jai’lyn Merriweather, who in 2017 ran the 400 in 53.83 seconds.”
