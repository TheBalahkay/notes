## PREFACE
____________
This document outlines my reasons for believing that Trump purposely attempted to overturn the 2020 election through a number of legal and illegal means. Once it became clear that [[#Trump knew he had lost the election and that there was no evidence of voter fraud that would have come even close to changing the results of the election. All of his white house counsel re-affirmed this.|Trump had lost the election]] and that his claims of voter fraud were proven false, he [[#Trump threatened the attorney general, Jeffery Rosen with his job to send a memo to the states saying that the DOJ had found widespread fraud, even though he was told repeatedly by the attorney general and other staffers that those claims were false|threatened the attorney general]] with his job to send a memo to the states which declared that the DOJ had found widespread voter fraud; However he was told repeatedly by the attorney general and other staffers that no evidence of widespread or outcome determinative voter fraud existed. He then [[#Trump set up 7 fraudulent slates of electors for 7 different states that signed him the winner instead of Biden (Kenneth Chesburo to Eastman plot. )|arranged for 7 false sets of electors]] to sign fake certification documents to be used on January 6th to declare him the winner of the swing states he lost.  He [[#Trump pressured Mike pence publicly and privately to sign in the fraudulent state electors, to give Trump an electoral victory or have it sent to the house to vote under false pretenses|publicly and privately pressured the Vice President]] to use the false electorates to defy the constitution’s electoral count act to deny the certification of the election or falsely declare Trump the winner.  He continued to do this even after the Vice President told him repeatedly it was outside of his authority. This plot was [[#Public pressure|mentioned in his speech]] on January 6th and is why Trump said that Pence has failed us later that day while the riot at the capital building was happening. After his speech and during the riot Trump and Giuliani [[#Trump utilized the chaos on Jan 6th riot to pressure state senators into accepting his slate of fraudulent electors|made calls to different state senators]] to pressure them to overturn the results of the election. Trump did this while his White House staff and family begged him to do something to stop the riot at the capital and it wasn’t until 3 hours after the riot had started, the certification had been delayed, and after his efforts to pressure state senators had failed that Trump sent out a tweet telling everyone to go home.

It’s important to note that Trump did all of this while knowing full well that there was no outcome determinative voter fraud. None of the things I’ve stated above are disputed and all of it is publicly available. Trumps legal team doesn’t even dispute these claims which is why he needed to ask for criminal immunity for the Jack Smith indictments.  I will outline my reasons and evidence for this in the document  below. Each reason will be linked to a section that details and sources my reasons for said claim:

## Primary Claims
____________

### Trump set up 7 fraudulent slates of electors for 7 different states that signed him the winner instead of Biden (Kenneth Chesburo to Eastman plot. )
##### Summary
Trump and his private team of lawyers put together a plan to create 7 slates of electors for the swing states that he had lost and fraudulently claimed that they were duly elected and certified by the states. In truth the elector slates had absolutely no merit and many of the perpetrators who signed on to be the "electors" in this scheme were either tricked or have been prosecuted with felony charges for election forgery. The plan was to use these false electors as a means to circumvent the electoral count act and give Pence an excuse to throw out the swing states votes due to there being questions on which slate of electors were real. By removing the swing states vote Trump would then technically have more electoral votes than Biden and would be declared the winner. Pence could have also used the fraudulent slates to throw the election to the house of representatives which would then vote on the winner of the election. Since each state gets only one vote, and the republicans had majority, Trump could have also won that way. Trump was told both by his the VP and his own lawyers that this idea was unconstitutional.

9. Trump referencing the electorate scheme in his j6 [speech](https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/news/documents/2021/01/13/Trump_Jan._6_speech.pdf): 
	1. Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we’re going to walk down and I’ll be there with you. We’re going to walk down — (APPLAUSE) — we’re going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol — (APPLAUSE) — and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. (LAUGHTER) Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. (APPLAUSE) <span style="color:#0070c0">We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated. Lawfully slated.</span>
10. Trump knew the ask of Pence was unconstitutional: [J6 report: p 428 (pdf 454) subsection 3-6](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf)
	1. On January 4, 2021, President Trump summoned Vice President Pence to a meeting in the Oval Office with John Eastman, a law professor representing President Trump in litigation challenging the election result. Eastman argued, on President Trump’s behalf, that the Vice President could take matters into his own hands during the joint session on January 6th. Eastman offered Vice President Pence two options. First, the Vice President could unilaterally reject the certified electors from several States won by former Vice President Biden, thereby handing the presidency to President Trump. Or, according to Eastman, Vice President Pence could delay the joint session to give State legislatures the opportunity to certify new electors loyal to the President. <span style="color:#0070c0">Eastman admitted, in front of the president, that both options violated the Electoral Count Act of 1887</span>, the statute that sets forth the process for counting and disputing electoral votes during the joint session. Eastman admitted as much in a subsequent conversation with the Vice President’s staff as well. Therefore, President Trump knew, or should have known, that this scheme was illegal—in fact, it violated the Electoral Count Act and the U.S. Constitution. President Trump repeatedly demanded that Vice President Pence go through with it anyway.
11. Delivering the fake electorats to Pence: [J6 report: p 43 (pdf 69) subsection 230-235](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf)
	1. Despite the fact that all major election lawsuits thus far had failed, President Trump and his co-conspirators in this effort, including John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro, pressed forward with the fake elector scheme. Ultimately, these false electoral slates, five of which purported to represent the “duly elected” electoral college votes of their States, were transmitted to Executive Branch officials at the National Archives, and to the Legislative Branch, including to the Office of the President of the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence. The fake electors followed Chesebro’s step-by-step instructions for completing and mailing the fake certificates to multiple officials in the U.S. Government, complete with registered mail stickers and return address labels identifying senders like the “Arizona Republican Party” and the “Georgia Republican Party.” The Wisconsin Republican Party’s fake certificates apparently weren’t properly delivered, however, so the Trump Campaign arranged to fly them to Washington just before the joint session on January 6th, and try to deliver them to the Vice President via Senator Ron Johnson and Representative Mike Kelly’s offices. Both Johnson and Kelly’s offices attempted to do so, but Vice President Pence’s aide refused the delivery.
12. [J6 report: p 108-109 (pdf 134-135) subsection 627-631](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf)
	1. There should be no question that section 1001 applies here. The false electoral slates were provided both to the executive branch (the National Archives) and the legislative branch. The statute applies to “any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of theGovernment of the United States.” It is well established that false statements to Congress can constitute violations of section 1001. Finally, the false statement was made knowingly and willfully. There is some evidence suggesting that some signatories of the fake certificates believed that the certificates were contingent, to be used only in the event that President Trump prevailed in litigation challenging the election results in their States. That may be relevant to the question whether those electors knowingly and willfully signed a false statement at the time they signed the certificates. But it is of no moment to President Trump’s conduct, as President Trump (including acting through co-conspirators such as John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro) relied on the existence of those fake electors as a basis for asserting that the Vice President could reject or delay certification of the Biden electors. <span style="color:#0070c0">In fact, as explained earlier and in Chapter 5 of 108 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY this Report, Eastman’s memorandum setting out a six-step plan for overturning the election on January 6th begins by stating that “7 states have transmitted dual slates of electors to the President of the Senate.”</span> The remaining question is who engaged in this conspiracy to make the false statement to Congress under section 1001. <span style="color:#0070c0">The evidence is clear that President Trump personally participated in a scheme to have the Trump electors meet, cast votes, and send their votes to the joint session of Congress in several States that Vice President Biden won, and then his supporters relied on the existence of these fake electors as part of their effort to obstruct the joint session. Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel testified before this Committee that President Trump and Eastman directly requested that the RNC organize the effort to have these fake (i.e., Trump) electors meet and cast their votes</span>

### Trump knew he had lost the election and that there was no evidence of voter fraud that would have come even close to changing the results of the election. All of his white house counsel re-affirmed this.
##### Summary
Trumps white house counsel, campaign leaders, and hired investigators repeatedly told him that they were unable to find any evidence of voter fraud that would change the election in any state. The instances of voter fraud they did find were small, localized and perpetrated by both sides. Trump brought forth 64 court cases of voter fraud, twenty were dismissed before a hearing on the merits, fourteen were voluntarily dismissed by Trump and his supporters before a hearing on the merits, and 30 cases included a hearing on the merits. Of the 30 cases that went to trial 29 ruled against the president. Only one ruled in favor of Trump in [Pensilvania](https://www.courthousenews.com/trump-ekes-out-a-small-win-against-extension-to-cure-pennsylvania-ballots/), which found that the Secretary of State Kathy Brockvar couldn't extend the deadline to provide photo ID for mail in ballots from November 6th to November 9th. Many of the cases included republican judges that were appointed by Trump. The president talked with his attorney general and other staff nearly every day to talk about his cases and other claims of widespread voter fraud. In every instance the claims ended up being inaccurate and his staff made it clear to Trump that the election was not fraudulent and were held fairly. If Trump did believe the election was fraudulent despite all his counsel saying otherwise then he was willingly deceiving himself to the point of delusion. Whether or not he believed his claims of voter fraud has no bearing on the legality of his actions. 

It is also worth noting that Trumps lawyer Rudolph Giuliani recently lost a defamation case against Ruby Freeman in Georgia where he admitted to lying about voter fraud in the state farm building. where His defense was that he lied but he had a first amendment right to do so. See [[#"Black Box" Votes Hidden Under Table in Georgia]] for more on this.

It’s doubly worth noting that the Dominion voting machine accusations are completely false. Fox News was caught lying about it and an internal leak showed that the hosts knew it was fake but pushed it to keep viewers from going to OAN. Fox News made the one of largest settlements of its kind in history for the dominion defamation case. See [[#Dominion Vs Fox News]] for more.

- People who told Trump he had lost the election: All of these people were trusted by Trump to investigate claims of election fraud: ^c1e970
	1.  Bill Stepien, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's National Field Director</span> for his campaign, a lifelong Republican, who also worked on Giuliana's presidential campaign in 2007-2008, told Trump he had lost on election night.
	2. Chris Miller, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's Director of the National Counterterrorism Center</span>, attested that Matt Oczkowski, Trump's campaign's top data scientist, told him on election night that he was going to lose.
	3. William Barr, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's Attorney General of the Department of Justice</span>, told Trump repeatedly that he'd investigated and found absolutely no signs of voter fraud.
	4. Jeffry Rosen, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's acting Attorney General of the Department of Justice</span>, called or met with Trump almost every day to tell him there was no election fraud.
	5. Richard Donoghue, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's acting deputy attorney general</span>, told Trump the information he was getting was false.
	6. Chris Stirewalt, <span style="color:#0070c0">former Fox New political editor</span>, said that Trump had no chance of winning the election after the votes were counted.
	7. Jason Miller, the <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump Campaign Senior Advisor</span>, informed Trump several times that there wasn't enough evidence of fraud to overturn the election.
		1. "When our research and campaign legal team can't back up any of the claims made by our Elite Strike Force Legal Team, you can see why we're 0-32 on our cases. I'll obviously hustle to help on all fronts, but it's tough to own any of this when it's all just conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership."
	8. Mike Pence, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's Vice President</span>, said there was never evidence of widespread fraud, and that he believed there was no good evidence of enough fraud to overturn the election.
	9. Matthew Morgan, the <span style="color:#0070c0">General Counsel of Trump's campaign</span>, claimed that the Trump staff, including him and Marc Short and Greg Jacob, didn't believe there was sufficient evidence of voter fraud.
	10. Brad Raffensperger, the <span style="color:#0070c0">Republican Georgia Secretary of State</span>, denied every single claim that Trump made about election Fraud.
	11. Brian Kemp, the <span style="color:#0070c0">Republican Governor of Georgia</span>, denied that the election was stolen in Georgia.
	12. Eleven of the judges who ruled against Trump were <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump federal judiciary appointments</span>.
		1. One of those Trump nominees, Judge Stephanos Bibas of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, rejected an appeal by the Trump Campaign claiming that Pennsylvania officials “did not undertake any meaningful effort” to fight illegal absentee ballots and uneven treatment of voters across counties. Judge Bibas wrote in his decision that “calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.” Another Trump nominee, Judge Brett Ludwig of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, ruled against President Trump’s lawsuit alleging that the result was skewed by illegal procedures that governed drop boxes, ballot address information, and individuals who claimed“ indefinitely confined” status to vote from home. Judge Ludwig wrote in his decision, that “this Court has allowed plaintiff the chance to make his case and he has lost on the merits” because the procedures used “do not remotely rise to the level” of breaking Wisconsin’s election rules.
	13. Ivanka and Kushner, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's daughter and son-in-law</span>, prepared to move right after the election, with Ivanka stating she believed Barr's testimony.
	14. Alex Cannon, <span style="color:#0070c0">Trump's campaign lawyer</span>, said he told advisers that there was no election fraud.

### Trump threatened the attorney general, Jeffery Rosen with his job to send a memo to the states saying that the DOJ had found widespread fraud, even though he was told repeatedly by the attorney general and other staffers that those claims were false
##### Summary
Trump pressured the attorney general Jeffery Rosen to send out a memo to states claiming that the DOJ had found overwhelming voter fraud. This request was made despite Rosen telling Trump numerous times that he had found absolutely no evidence of the kind. It is important to note that a few weeks prior the then acting Attorney General Bill Bar had resigned. Trump went on to attempt to replace Rosen with Jeffery Clark since Clark had told the president he would send the memo. This move was made even worse as Clark was an environmental lawyer and did not have the experience necessary to head up the DOJ. It appears that Trumps sole reason for wanting Clark is because he agreed to lie for Trump. The only reason Trump did not replace Rosen was because most of his Whitehouse staff threatened to quit if he did.

### Trump pressured Mike pence publicly and privately to sign in the fraudulent state electors, to give Trump an electoral victory or have it sent to the house to vote under false pretenses
##### Summary 
Trump pressured Pence both publicly and privately to certify his slate of false electors or use the "confusion" around the rightful slate to stop the count and send the vote to the house where the vote would be in favor of Trump since each state gets one vote and republicans controlled the house. Trump and his lawyers knew what he was asking for was unconstitutional. Pence refused which is why he is not trumps VP pick for 2024.

##### Evidence
###### Private pressure

- [J6 report: p 35-36 (pdf 61-62) after sentence 178](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf)
	- President Trump tried to reach the Vice President early in the morning of January 6th, but the Vice President did not take the call. The President finally reached the Vice President later that morning, shouting from the Oval Office to his assistants to “get the Vice President on the phone. After again telling the Vice President that he had “the legal authority to send [electoral votes] back to the respective states,” President Trump grew very heated. Witnesses in the Oval Office during this call told the Select Committee that the President called Vice President Pence a “wimp,” told him it would be “a political career killer” to certify the lawful electoral votes electing President Biden, and accused him of “not [being] tough enough to make the call.” As Ivanka Trump would recount to her chief of staff moments later, her father called the Vice President “the p-word” for refusing to overturn the election. In response, Vice President Pence again refused to take any action other than counting the lawfully certified electoral votes of the States. But President Trump was angry and undeterred. After the conclusion of this call, he edited his speech for the Ellipse to insert language to which his lawyers objected—targeting Vice President Pence directly.

###### Public pressure
- [Trump tells pence he is too honest when he refused to reject the legitimate electorate slates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/08/03/pence-capitalizes-on-trump-indictment-with-too-honest-campaign-merchandise/)
- ###### Trump mentions pence repeatedly in his [speech](https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/news/documents/2021/01/13/Trump_Jan._6_speech.pdf) on January 6th saying that he needs to do "The right thing" (This is not an exhaustive list) ^bf1289
	- All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to re-certify and we become president and you are the happiest people.
	- Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I'm not hearing good stories.
	- The Republicans have to get tougher. You're not going to have a Republican Party if you don't get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so, sir, yes, the United States. The Constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to the States. Well, I say, yes it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can't vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.
- **Trump didn't care what happened to pence once it was clear he was not going along with the plan**
	- At 1:02pm ET on January 6th: 
		Pence refuses to go along with Trump's plan to pick and choose electors, and news outlets tweet his letter stating in part, "It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not."
			- https://x.com/NBCNews/status/1346880034536103938
	- At 2:42pm on January 6th: 
		- Trump tweets Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth
			- https://x.com/usatgraphics/status/1347376642956603392?lang=en
	- Within an hour after the above tweet, Pat Cipollone complained to Mark Meadows that "we need to do something more. They’re literally calling for the Vice President to be [fucking] hung." Meadows suggested that there was nothing to do, given that Trump "thinks Mike deserves it." According to Trump aide Nick Luna, when Trump was told that Pence had to be moved for his safety, Trump responded: "So what?"

### Trump utilized the chaos on Jan 6th riot to pressure state senators into accepting his slate of fraudulent electors
##### Summary
Trump was informed by his staff at 1:25 EST that there was rioting at the capital building. between that time and 4:17 pm EST Trump had Pat Cipollone, Kushner (ivanka trumps husband), Ivanka Trump, and other staffers coming to Trump to request that he make a public statement asking the rioters to leave the capital. Trump refused to make any statements and instead made calls to Rudolph Giuliani and then to a number of senators to "talk objections to the electoral count".  

##### Evidence

To get a better idea of this I recommend reading [j6-executive summary page 77-84(pdf 103-110) after subsection 458](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf)

Excerpts From the J6 report on what Trump did during the riot: 

- [page 84 (PDF: 110) subsection 499](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf): Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R–WA), to whom McCarthy spoke soon after, relayed more of the conversation between McCarthy and President Trump: And he said [to President Trump], “You have got to get on TV. You’ve got to get on Twitter. You’ve got to call these people off.” You know what the President said to him? This is as it’s happening. He said, “Well Kevin, these aren’t my people. You know, these are Antifa. And Kevin responded and said, “No, they’re your people. They literally just came through my office windows and my staff are running for cover. I mean they’re running for their lives. You need to call them off.” And the President’s response to Kevin to me was chilling. He said, “Well Kevin, I guess they’re just more upset about the election, you know, theft than you are”

- [page 78-79 (PDF: 103-104) subsection 471](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf): Cipollone knew immediately that the President had to deliver a message to the rioters—asking them to leave the Capitol. Here is how he described this series of events: . . . the first time I remember going downstairs was when people had breached the Capitol… But I went down with [Deputy White House Counsel] Pat [Philbin], and I remember we were both very upset about what was happening. And we both wanted, you know, action to be taken related to that . . . But we went down to the Oval Office, we went through the Oval office, and we went to the back where the President was. . . . I think he was already in the dining room . . . I can’t talk about conversations [with the President]. I think I was pretty clear there needed to be an immediate and forceful response, statement, public statement, that people need to leave the Capitol now. Cipollone also left little doubt that virtually everyone among senior White House staff had the same view: There were a lot of people in the White House that day . . . Senior people who, you know, felt the same way that I did and who were working very hard to achieve that result. There were—I think 78 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Ivanka was one of them. And Eric Herschmann was there, Pat Philbin was there, and a number of other people . . . . many people suggested it. . . . Many people felt the same way. I’m sure I had conversations with Mark [Meadows] about this during the course of the day and expressed my opinion very forcefully that this needs to be done.

- [page 597-598 (PDF: 623-624) subsection 178](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf): Minutes after drawing increased attention to his besieged Vice President, the President called newly elected Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama at 2:26 p.m. He misdialed, calling Senator Mike Lee of Utah instead, but one passed the phone to the other in short order. President Trump wanted to talk objections to the electoral count. But Senator Tuberville—along with every other elected official trapped and surrounded in the building—had other things on his mind. “I said, ‘Mr. President, they’ve taken the Vice President out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go,’” Senator Tuberville told reporters.
	- page 78 (PDF: 104) subsection 178: it appears that at 1:39 p.m. and2:03 p.m., after being informed of the riot at the Capitol, President Trump called his lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani. These calls lasted approximately four minutes and eight minutes, respectively. And Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany testified that President Trump also called a number of Senators. The number or names of all such Members of Congress is unknown, although Senator Mike Lee (R–UT) received one such outgoing call fromthe President within the hour that followed. https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2021/02/11/what-sen-mike-lee-told-me/

### Trump purposely tried to stop the vote because he knew that he had lost

##### Summary
The election occurred on November 3rd and went as everyone predicted, with Donald Trump initially having a large lead and then slowly losing it as mail-in ballots were counted as the night progressed.

At 11:20 PM, Fox News [called Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/us/politics/trump-fox-news-arizona.html) for Joe Biden, sending Donald Trump and his team into a fury. Jason Miller [tweeted out](https://x.com/JasonMillerinDC/status/1323849305917186050), admonishing Fox News for calling the election early. Jared Kushner was also in contact with Rupert Murdoch as the night went on. At 2:30 AM the following morning, Trump told supporters "[this is a fraud on the American public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duE8tnrSmNc&t=442s)." Trump said he wanted to go to the Supreme Court to stop the counting of ballots, then declared himself the winner of the election. Pence went up on stage afterwards, contradicting Trump and saying that, while he was sure they'd won the election, he would wait until every vote was counted.

Trump tried to stop the vote on the night of the election before all the mail in ballots had come in. He did this because he knew that the mail in votes would heavily favor Biden. This should not be surprising. Trump had spent months demonizing the mail in ballot process and encouraging his supporters to vote in person. Even Bernie Sanders was able to predict that this would happen. Trump knew this would happen and according to Steve Bannon, [planned to try to stop the vote early to combat this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxNoUnxN_cs).

### Trump tried to challenge the vote in multiple states using largely BS evidence. Georgia in particular was especially inappropriate
##### Summary
Trump challenged the election results with 64 cases across the country. Many of those were dropped by trumps team once they got to the point where they needed to present evidence. Many of the cases that went to trial saw trumps team showing up with no evidence.

##### Evidence

**Excerpt from [Lost, Not Stolen ](https://lostnotstolen.org//wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lost-Not-Stolen-The-Conservative-Case-that-Trump-Lost-and-Biden-Won-the-2020-Presidential-Election-July-2022.pdf)**
	 - The report concludes “that Donald Trump and his supporters had their day in court and failed to produce substantive evidence to make their case.” President Trump and his legal allies “failed because of a lack of evidence and not because of erroneous rulings or unfair judges . . . . In many cases, after making extravagant claims of wrongdoing, Trump’s legal representatives showed up in court or state proceedings empty-handed, and then returned to their rallies and media campaigns to repeat the same unsupported claims.”


###### "Black Box" Votes Hidden Under Table in Georgia
^b9ffd6

Rudy Giuliani [tweeted](https://x.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1334585579510652928) a heavily cut up video propagated by OAN that claimed boxes of illegitimately filled ballot boxes were being counted after election officials told counters to go home. Election officials investigated and [released additional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-9jFuieH_U) and explanations showing that these claims were fabricated. Giuliani would later [admit to lying](https://theconversation.com/giuliani-claims-the-first-amendment-lets-him-lie-3-essential-reads-210514) in court about this case, [claiming](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.238720/gov.uscourts.dcd.238720.84.2.pdf) it was his 1st amendment right to lie. He would [lose that case](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rudy-giuliani-loses-bid-dismiss-148-million-defamation/story?id=109264527#:~:text=The%20former%20lawyer%20for%20Donald%20Trump%20defamed%20two%20election%20workers.&text=Rudy%20Giuliani%20has%20lost%20his,and%20Wandrea%20%22Shaye%22%20Moss.) to the tune $148,000,000, and then have a bankruptcy case [dismissed](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/rudy-giuliai-bankruptcy-case-thrown-out/5590151/#:~:text=Updated%20on%20July%2012%2C%202024%20at%208%3A04%20pm&text=A%20judge%20threw%20out%20Rudy,defamation%20judgment%20and%20other%20debts.) that he filed to avoid paying this debt due to lying about his assets.

###### Dominion Vs Fox News

In June of 2021, Dominion [filed a complaint](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23731963-dominion_3-21-23_hearing_slides-used-at-hearing_redacted ) against Fox News, alleging that the company engaged in a widespread campaign of defamatory behavior towards Dominion in order to salvage its reputation among conservative media listeners. Fox settled the lawsuit for $787.5 million dollars which was a quarter of their gross earnings in 2022. Dominion's lawsuit accused Fox of lying on four separate claims:
1. Dominion committed election fraud by rigging the 2020 Presidential Election
2. Dominion’s software and algorithms manipulated vote counts in the 2020 Presidential Election
3. Dominion is owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for the dictator Hugo Chávez; and
4. Dominion paid kickbacks to government officials who used its machines in the 2020 Presidential Election.

Factual Allegations
- Dominion was established in 2002 by CEO John Poulos and procured its first contract with New York state in July 2009. 
- After it became clear that Trump would lose into the election, on November 6th, Donald Trump began to complain that his lead had "mysteriously disappeared."
- On November 7th, Fox projected Trump had lost the election.
- On November 8th, Fox invited Sidney Powell onto the *Sunday Morning Futures* show to discuss Dominion voting fraud.
	- Powell declared that there was “a massive and coordinated effort to steal this election from We the People of the United States of America, to delegitimize and destroy votes for Donald Trump, to manufacture votes for Joe Biden.” 
- ...more to the [complaint](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Dominion-Complaint-Fox.pdf), I don't have time to read through all of this right now, though.

Dominion's [motion for summary judgement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23731963-dominion_3-21-23_hearing_slides-used-at-hearing_redacted) contains many damming emails showing that Fox News was knowingly capitalizing on fraudulent election claims to win back their audience after election night

### Trump has no defense for this, which is why he had to ask for immunity from the Supreme Court to defend against the Jack smith indictments
##### Summary
Trumps lawyers for the Jack Smith indictments were arguing that for the president to be charged criminally for conspiracy to defraud the United states, he needed to first be impeached. They did not argue that Trump did not do the alleged actions, nor that he couldn't/shouldn't be criminally charged. Just that he was immune until after he had been impeached.

##### Evidence
- indictment: https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump_23_cr_257.pdf
- supreme court Immunity opinions: https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf

## Counters to common claims

## J6 committee was totally biased
Nancy Pelosi tried to get GOP representatives on the J6 committee. The GOP put forth 5 picks and 2 of those, Jim Jordan and Jim Banks, got rejected. They were rejected because they were going to be investigated by the hearing and it was a conflict of interest to also have them on the board. Given the seriousness of the investigation and the need for the board members to stay neutral this call makes sense. The GOP could have replaced Jordan and Banks or at least kept on their other three picks. Instead of suggesting new appointees the republicans said fuck it and didn't include anyone. They claim it was because they didn't want to be a part of a sham investigation; However I would think that this would be even more reason to have your picks in there to help combat any would be misinformation. My thought is that they did this to be able to claim that the committee was biased and dismiss any and all claims that came from it. No matter how strong the evidence. A cop out to avoid facing the facts. It's also worth keeping in mind that much of the J6 committee was direct testimony from those in trumps counsel. To have faked all of this while having the hearings recorded and televised is just a unbelievable assertion made with absolutely zero evidence.
