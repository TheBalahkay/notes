## redditors summary 
Sure thing!

Here is the link to the entire indictment.  It's very long and gets juicier in the second half so take into consideration whether they will actually read through it all:

In general, my advice would be:

1.	⁠Stray away from talking about the crowd.  Everyone knows about that. Give new information that they don't have reactionary excuses for
2.	⁠Emphasize that he was trying to get the electoral votes switched WITHOUT actually proving fraud.  He lost ~65 court cases, and these courts were not all biased.
3.	⁠List off the ways in which he was trying to get the vote switched then you can prove each one or just have him read the indictment

a. Arranged for false electors to sign fake certification documents to be used on january 6th to declare him the winner of the swing states he lost

b. Him and his lawyers contacted the republican heads of swing state legislatures to try to convince them to hold emergency sessions and have a vote to switch their states electors

c. Threatened the attorney general with his job to send a memo to the states saying that the DOJ had found widespread fraud, even though he was told repeatedly by that very person that that was not the case. The letter was drafted and ready to sign and the AG was pressured on multiple occasions and even "fired" at one point as trump verbally told Jeffrey Clark he was AG, even though it was never official due to the meeting discussed in the indictment and the youtube videos below

d. Publicly and privately pressured the Vice President to deny the certification of the election results even after the Vice President told him repeatedly it was outside of his authority

e. After the mob entered the capitol on January 6th, he declined to send out a message asking his supporters to leave the capital for hours.  After around 20 minutes and while he was being persuaded to send out such a message, he instead sent a message saying that Mike Pence needed to do the right thing.  (The only part of Jan 6th I like to mention is his lack of action while it was going on, and it should be mentioned last)

I think (c) is the most compelling and these two youtube videos in my opinion are very convincing.  In my email to my father in law I said the following:

All Three of the men responding in the videos, the three highest ranking officials in the DOJ at the time, are all republicans and Adam Kinzinger, the man asking the questions is also a republican.  Note that Bill Barr, also a republican was at the top of the DOJ just weeks before this meeting and resigned due to his disagreement with Trump regarding election fraud.

If you don't think they'll read the entire indictment I clipped out just the parts about (c) above which is not as long and is extremely compelling along with the videos.  I have it in a word document I can share if you don't think they'll read the whole indictment.
