# FBI vets: What many are missing about the infamous 'dossier' amid Russia probe
## Article 
https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-vets-missing-infamous-dossier-amid-russia-probe/story?id=52309501

## Summary
This article claims that the steele dossier, Named after Chistopher Steele whom
wrote it, is used to discredit the findings from the Mueller and January 17th
report. The dossier is/was unverified which is precisely why the FBI decided to
look into the allegations. The FBI did not accept the dossier as evidence, and
the FBI had information that warranted a probe even without the dossier. Steele
was a former MI6 agent. He was described by Frank Montoya, who spent more than
two decades with the FBI and another two years leading U.S. counter
intelligence policy under the Director of National Intelligence, as a "proven",
"well-regarded", and "known entity" in the intelligence community. 

Steele was hired In 2016 by was hired by Glenn Simpson after his firm, Fusion
GPS, signed a contract with a lawyer for the Democratic National Committee to
conduct research on Trump. Steele claimed that sources he spoke with overseas
told him that Trump maintained a "compromising relationship whith the Kremlin"
perhaps even to the point where Trump could be blackmailed. He felt
"Professionally obligated" to tell someone in our government about the
information. His report contained many salacious claims, but the broad
implications-that Russian President Bladamir Putin launched an operation to
boost Trump and sow discord it the US and abroad- proved to be true. In later
investigations at least Four Trump assaciates were charged with financial
crimes and lying to the FBI about contacts with russians. The Steele dossier is
not mentioned in the charges filed, the report or any testimony offered by US
officials. John Brennan, the former CIA Director noted that "The dossier wasn't
used at all" to conclude that Russia meddled in the election and worked to
boost Trump’s candidacy, Brennan told a national security forum last year. He
also told lawmakers that "It wasn't part of the body of intelligence
information that we had,". 

One piece of other evidence that promted investigations was when the FBI found
that two weeks before Steele's report Donald Trump Jr. received an email
offering "to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and
information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and
would be very useful to your father." The email brought about the now-infamous
meeting at Trump Tower with Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya
on June 9, 2016 — 11 days before Steele wrote his first report, and more than
six weeks before Wikileaks would release a trove of emails stolen by Russian
hackers from the DNC. 

Ultimately the articles sentiment can be summed up by Montoya's comment about
dismissing the investigations due to the dossier: "They not only misunderstand
how these kinds of investigations are conducted, but knowingly attempt to
discredit the investigation ... by playing on that misunderstanding,".

In the Trump-Russia case, it took at most three weeks.

In 2016 Steele claimed that sources he that overseas told him that Trump maintained a "compromising relationship whith the Kremlin" perhaps even to the point where Trump could be blackmailed. He felt obligated to tell someone in our government about the information. He felt "Professionally obligated"

> ***Frank Montoya, who spent more than two decades with the FBI and another two years leading U.S. counterintelligence policy under the Director of National Intelligence***
> Fact is, I've opened many cases on the basis of information that was a lot less detailed than what was in the dossier, from sources a lot less reliable...That is the whole point of conducting an investigation ... to determine if the information is valid, or not.

The stele dossier is not mentioned in the dharges filed, the report or any testimony offered by US officials.

Steele was hired by Glenn Simpson from fusion GPS wha had been hired by both Republicans and Democrats to do research on us candidates

Steele was hired by Simpson after his firm, Fusion GPS, signed a contract with a lawyer for the Democratic National Committee to conduct research on Trump. The firm's initial client was a Republican.

FBI found that two weeks before Steele's report Donald Trump Jr. received an email offering "to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father."

The email brought about the now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower with Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya on June 9, 2016 — 11 days before Steele wrote his first report, and more than six weeks before Wikileaks would release a trove of emails stolen by Russian hackers from the DNC.

Russians did offer business deals to Trump that he ultimately turned down.

Cohen filed a pair of lawsuits, one in federal court against Fusion GPS and the other in state court against the popular website BuzzFeed, which first published the dossier in full

Trump and other Republicans accuse the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller of conducting an investigation based on a "dossier that was all dressed up" and "paid for by the Clinton campaign," as Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, put it during a House hearing in December.

law enforcement veterans say such criticism seems to misunderstand — or deliberately misconstrue — the role that something like the dossier plays in investigations.

"They not only misunderstand how these kinds of investigations are conducted, but knowingly attempt to discredit the investigation ... by playing on that misunderstanding," Montoya said in an email to ABC News.
