### chapter 1 

Feyre is hunting in the woods late into winter. She is the hunter/provider of the family which includes her father and  2 sisters. While hunting she encounters a large wolf who she worries is a faerie. The wolf and her were hunting the same deer and feyre waits for the wolf to attack and kill the deer before killing the wolf and stealing its prey. Along the way we hear about prythian. It is where immortals and faeri live. Apparently border like hers  in the area have been being wiped out by the immortal beings that live there or at least those are the rumors. In the eight years she’s lived there she has never encountered one. Also she does not believe or pray to any gods. 

Questions: 
1. Why can’t her father hunt
2. What do her sisters do
3. Why did they move to where they are 8 years ago
4. How old is feyre 
5. Where is her mother - died 11 years ago


### Chapter 2
Here we learn about feyre’s family. 11 years ago her mother died around the same time they lost their manor and wealth. Creditors had come and beat their father’s knee in which took several years and the rest of their money to heal, though he still can not walk without pain and a cane. Nests is the eldest sister whom is jealouse and lazy. She seems to expect those around her to dot on her like servants. Elain seems to be naive and relatively innocent. Neither helping much nor causing trouble. She gifted feyre paints one year when Feyre bought an ash arrow for killing faerie. 

Nesta and Elaine argued over which of them would get to use the money from the pelts of the wolf and deer. Elain needed a new cloak, hers was thread bare. Nesta had pristine shoes but wanted new ones. No one thought to let Feyre use it to get new boots as hers were falling apart. 

The father seems aloof and uncaring. Unwilling to challenge or discipline nesta, and only talking to Elaine. 

Feyre made a vow to her dying mother that she would take care of the family. Why she should do this when she was the youngest is left unexplained to her or the reader

Questions: 
1. At this point I don’t really like feyre. She seems to be the most capable of the group and takes care of her family, but also seems to dislike them all as well. She has not done anything specifically to make me not like her but at the same time I’ve not seen anything from her that makes me particularly like her either. 
### chapter 3
 F meets a mercenary who buys her pelts and overpays for them. We find out she has fought fey and has lasting scars to show for it. One of which poisons her veins and may one day kill her. We also meet a cult who worship fey. We learn that wearing silver is supposed to honor them, while iron the opposite. Iron must be potent for killing and maiming fey. F’s ash arrows head  was iron. The people of the town wear iron to “ward” against fey. Though it’s likely useless. 

### chapter 4
Turns out the beast f killed was a fey. Its friend came into f’s house and gave her a choice. A life for a life. She could be murdered that night or live the rest of her life with him in prythian. She chose the latter. She somehow still sees this choice as forgoing her vow to her mom. As she leaves she tells the family where to hunt and how to hopefully survive the rest of winter and into spring. She warns nests that her would be suitor Thomas is the child of a man who beats his wife. He does nothing to stop it. 

Comments
More respect for f now. Specifically at the end in how she came to tell her family how to survive and warned nests of how bad Thomas was.
