Project 2025: 


Glenn beck and roberts conversation: 
- kevin roberts:
    

- Beck: this is something the heritage foundation has done every year. My response:
  The heritage foundation has put out a policy plan every year. what makes this one
  different is its length and scope. usually their plan is around 10-20 pages. this one
  is over 900 and includes a specific plan to fire much of the white house staff and
  replace them with what looks to be ideologues for their specific brand of
  conservative.

- Beck to roberts: Is this a plot to carve out special exemptions for fascism?
  roberts: 
    - deflects and says this is projection from the left. 
    - claims dems have focused power on unelected officials. ***My response***: 
        - can't prove a negative. don't worry about this claim for now.
        - specific counter example: like trumps 3 new supreme court picks who handed
          him criminal immunity?
    - Project 2025 wants to get rid of the administrative state and get rid of the
      problem of when a new president is elected nothing seems to change. ***My
      response***: the president shouldn't be in charge of sweeping changes in
      government. he is simply the head of the executive which focuses on the
      military and enforcement of our laws. removing the administrative state to
      allow for big changes president to president sounds a lot like giving the
      president more power.
    - restore the three branches to their original intent ***My response***: where?
      how? nothing is said here. 
- Beck: 2025 ensures that the president cant get his political rivals that everyday
  American's wont need to be afraid of the president coming for them or their
  freedoms. My response: by ensuring the president can act without being impeded by
  the administrative state? by getting rid of American's ability to marry who they
  want? by getting rid of women's right to choose? by censoring what words can be used
  in schools via a blacklist? <-- get page nums for all this.

- Roberts: if that abuse against used by the administrative state against the right
  by Biden were used by conservative they would be equally outraged.... trying to
  address the accrual of power. stop the weaponization of government. Director of FBI
  and the head attorney general of Biden's admin targeted the latin mass as being
  domestic terrorists. My response: source? quote? this is an extraordinary claim
  with 0 evidence presented. 

    this claim was debunked after a formal investigation and hearing. the employees
    who wrote the memo were disciplined and new guidelines for memo drafts were
    instituted. The memo never turned into action and was just a exploration of
    possible avenues for information collection. the fbi director immediately
    condemned the report. the memo was spurred on by a terrorist investigation into
    Xavier Lopez which resulted in illegal weapons charges including possession of
    Molotov cocktails.
