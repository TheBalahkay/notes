# Summary
Douglas County Public Utility District (PUD) is one of more than 2,000 public power systems that provides power on a not-for-profit basis in the United States. “Not-for-profit” means power is provided at the cost of producing and delivering that power. There are no stockholders expecting dividends from the power rates.

If you are a resident of Douglas County, you control the PUD by electing the [Commissioners](https://douglaspud.org/about-us/your-elected-commissioners/) who set policies and a manager to direct the operation of the utility. This provides local control over the utility and responsiveness to community needs. Electric utility revenues stay here and are invested in utility assets to provide service and hold prices down.
